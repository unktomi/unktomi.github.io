<h3>First class continuations in UE-4 Blueprints</h3>
<p>UE-4 Blueprints have a concept called &quot;Latent Actions&quot;, one of the simplest being <em>Delay</em> shown below which suspends
the current Blueprint for the specified number of seconds and then continues with whatever is connected to the <em>Completed</em> pin.</p>

<p>Currently all such latent actions show that clock icon.
Here is another example from a plugin, which suspends the Blueprint during a network operation and then continues when the result is
available:</p>

<p>In UE-4.10, latent action nodes are only allowed at the top level of a Blueprint &quot;event graph&quot;. They become inaccessible inside of functions. This is unfortunate because you are forced to use essentially global variables in such cases, and since an event graph contains a bunch of parallel event handlers, this quickly becomes a mess.</p>
<p>Blueprint graphs are in fact compiled to byte-code which is interpreted by a virtual machine written in C++. This vm uses an
explicit stack, vm functions being of the form</p>
<pre><code>void FUNC(FFrame &amp;Stack, void *Result). 
</code></pre>
<p>The 4.10 implementation creates the vm stack on
the C++ call stack, using alloca to reserve space for the local variables. That explains why latent actions are only allowed at the
top level, namely due to the fact that the instruction pointer and nothing else is preserved during the callback process. By preserving
(a copy of) the entire vm call stack, this limitation can be removed. Note that local variables are shared between any such copies,
only the instruction pointer of each frame is distinct. Now the copy must be allocated on the C++ heap rather than its stack in order to
persist until the callback occurs.</p>
<p>I've created a <a href='https://github.com/unktomi/Latent-Actions-Cont'>fork of 4.10</a> that makes the rather small changes necessary to enable the general use of latent actions.
In addition, it contains some experimental Blueprint nodes to enable using continuations directly in blueprints.
Continuations in a sense generalize function &quot;Return&quot; nodes and in fact can be used in place of them.
Here is an example of a normal return node:</p>
<p><img src="img/Cont0.PNG" alt=""></p>
<p>The below produces the same result via an explicit continuation:</p>
<p><img src="img/Cont1.PNG" alt=""></p>
<p>Here <em>Return Integer</em> is a function - which however itself does not return to its caller (hence it has no output pin). As you can see <em>Get Current Continuation</em> gives you a <em>Continuation</em> object that represents what will happen when the current function (in this case <em>Foo</em>) returns. This object can be stored in a variable and otherwise passed around. It provides a bunch of <em>Return</em> methods like <em>Return Integer</em> that you can call later - when you do it's as if you jump back in time and return again from the function (i.e. in this case <em>Foo</em>). You can actually do this more than once if you like and pass a different return value each time.</p>
<p>As an example we can implement coroutines just with Blueprints.</p>
<p><img src="img/Coroutine1.PNG" alt=""></p>
<p>Here we have two Continuation variables <em>Y</em> and <em>R</em>. <em>Y</em> represents the continuation of a <em>Yield</em> operation and <em>R</em> represents that of a <em>Wait for</em> operation. The implementation of the <em>Yield</em> operations save their continuation in <em>Y</em>, and of the <em>Wait for</em> in <em>R</em>:</p>
<p><img src="img/Coroutine2.PNG" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Run</em> is an abstract function the user implements in which <em>Yield</em> is called. <em>Wait for</em> is called from an event such as <em>Tick</em> to resume the coroutine.</p>
